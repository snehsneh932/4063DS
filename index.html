<h2>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are fundamental tools in computer science that help
in organizing data and solving problems efficiently.Data structures like <strong>arrays, linked lists,
stacks, and queues</strong> allow data to be stored and accessed in structured ways. Algorithms are 
step-by-step procedures used to manipulate data within these structures, such as searching, sorting,
and optimization. Mastering DSA is essential for building efficient software, as it enables better performance and
resource management.
